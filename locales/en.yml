    errors:
      missing_credentials: |-
        Unable to find AWS credentials.

        Ensure the following variables are set in your environment, or set
        them at the top of your Vagrantfile:

            AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
            AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

        Alternatively, you can create a credential profile and set the

            AWS_PROFILE

        environment variable. Consult the documentation for details.

      malformed_shorthand_url: |-
        Malformed shorthand S3 box URL:

        Check your `box_url` setting.

      s3_api_error: |-
        Unable to communicate with Amazon S3 to download box. The S3 API reports:

            %{error}

      bucket_location_access_denied_error: |-
        Request for box's Amazon S3 region was denied.

        This usually indicates that your user account is misconfigured. Ensure
        your IAM policy allows the "s3:GetBucketLocation" action for your bucket:

            arn:aws:s3:::%{bucket}

      box_download_forbidden: |-
        This box is hosted on Amazon S3. A 403 Forbidden error usually indicates
        that your user account is misconfigured. Ensure your IAM policy allows
        the "s3:GetObject" action for your bucket:

            arn:aws:s3:::%{bucket}/*

        It may also indicate the box does not exist, so check your spelling.
